## Login

POST: `/session`

This endpoint is used to login to the system. It returns a JWT token that can be used to access other endpoints named `access_token`.

The decoded access token will contains at least the following information:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "marion",
  "email": "marion@eveners.com"
}
```

The JWT secret will be `event-maker`, and the access token will be valid for 1 year.

For the sake of simplicity, we already have a predefined list of users that can be used for login in [here](./data/users.json).

**Example Request:**

```json
